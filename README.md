Say user 'A' has a hairdryer, perfectly working condition. And does not use it because s/he upgraded.
'A' as an environmentally aware and good soul lists the hairdryer on the 'GiveAway' app.
user 'B' needs a new hairdryer goes to GiveAway to check if the product s/he needs is available on the platform. If they find the product they connects with the user 'A' who listed the product.
They can decide on the exchange and related logistics.
User 'B' either thanks user 'A' for the generosity or buys him a beer.
