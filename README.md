Giving away unused items they own. And finding a product they need.

##### User journey

- Say user 'A' has a hairdryer, perfectly working condition. And does not use it because s/he upgraded.

- 'A' as an environmentally aware and good soul lists the hairdryer on the 'GiveAway' app.

- user 'B' needs a new hairdryer goes to GiveAway to check if the product s/he needs is available on the platform. If they find the product they connects with the user 'A' who listed the product.

- They can decide on the exchange and related logistics.

- User 'B' either thanks user 'A' for the generosity or buys him a beer.
